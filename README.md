"SimpleStorage DApp"
Problem Statement:-
In a world of decentralized applications, there's often a need for a simple way to store and retrieve data on the blockchain. This project demonstrates a basic storage DApp where users can store and retrieve messages using a smart contract. It showcases how blockchain technology can be used for decentralized data storage, offering an alternative to traditional centralized databases.

Project Overview:-
This project is a decentralized application (DApp) built with Solidity smart contracts, Truffle, Ganache for local blockchain, and Web3.js to interact with the Ethereum network. It uses a simple storage contract to allow users to store and retrieve string messages at specific indexes.

Features:
Users can store a message on the blockchain at a specific index.
Users can retrieve stored messages by providing an index.
Real-time interaction with the Ethereum blockchain using MetaMask.


Technologies Used:-
Solidity: Smart contract language to write the logic of the SimpleStorage contract.
Truffle: A development framework for Ethereum that helps manage smart contracts, migrations, and interactions with the blockchain.
Ganache: Local blockchain for development and testing purposes.
Web3.js: A JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
Express: A minimal Node.js web server to serve the frontend locally.
MetaMask: A browser extension for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain via Web3.
